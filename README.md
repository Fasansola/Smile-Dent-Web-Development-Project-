## How I Used JavaScript
I utilized JavaScript to build the mobile menu. By controlling the visibility when the menu icon is clicked, I created a seamless user experience. Additionally, I employed JavaScript to dynamically set the z-index of avatars on the home page, preventing overlapping issues.


## How I Used Bootstrap
Bootstrap played a pivotal role in structuring and ensuring responsiveness throughout the project. Leveraging the container-row-col layout, I adjusted col sizes across different designs. The use of padding, margin, and content alignment classes facilitated efficient design modifications.



## Disclaimer
The original design for this project was crafted by Blocksy Creative Themes as a premium starter theme on their platform [Creative Themes - Blocksy Starter Sites](https://creativethemes.com/blocksy/starter-sites/ "Smile Dent Original Design"). I chose to recreate and redevelop the site as a personal challenge to push my skills and tackle a real-world project.
